# Advanced React Patterns

This is my personal repository for the course [Advanced React Patterns](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/advanced-react-patterns/) hosted by [FrontEnd Masters](https://frontendmasters.com/).


> ***NOTE:** When I started the course, I copied the files from the wrong branch, `main`, instead of the `frontend-masters` brach, so there may be slightly differences in the implementation details of some of the components and tests. In addition to that, the `frontend-masters` has different versions of the exercises `10`, `11`, `12` and a bonus exercise `13` that is not in the `main` branch, so I had to copy those over as well.*
